Starting today (yup, right now), we are announcing **Ideas Grill**. Years of brainstorming have gone into this and now we’re going all in. You can view and comment on all the projects "on the grill" on the public Trello board: [https://trello.com/b/2TaxsEbm/ideas-grill#](https://trello.com/b/2TaxsEbm/ideas-grill# "https://trello.com/b/2TaxsEbm/ideas-grill#") (we're not shy)

The _Master Plan_ has three parts.

**1. Design Sprints.** (see [YouTube explainer](https://youtu.be/K2vSQPh6MCE))

Straight into the fire with the Google Ventures Design Sprint method, a raw idea goes in and 4 days later a product is tested on customers. It’s intense and you should [register your name](https://airtable.com/shrl8KSKpXPa04Wy0) to join us for one. Be there and you get equity in the new startup that comes out.

**2. Investibility Benchmark.**

Inspired by _Investible_, one of the most successful seed funds in the world, we’ve created a written exam to put a startup business to the ultimate test. It’s comprehensive and hard to pass, but passing takes your startup to the next level … investibility.

**3. Private Equity Seed Fund.**  
A (secret 🤫) Swiss partner is building us a platform for granting startups with seed capital from angel investors worldwide. This will come online later this year.

**OK, Design Sprints 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️💨**

**These are kinda intense! We can only do 1 per month. Because space is limited, you should register your name right now.**

Srsly, if you’re in Prague, just register and reserve a spot. The rest of this email can wait … 🤔

Here’s the gist of a _Design Sprint_ if you didn’t watch [the video](https://youtu.be/K2vSQPh6MCE_)...

We get a team together of 5-8 skilled people and everyone clears the calendar. And instead of a normal boring week of work, we go through a course of activities so that by the end of the week you’ve prototyped and tested a new idea with customers.

It's a really unique experience - ask anyone else who's done one.

**More Blockchain Hub Prague 🏠**

We have redefined what it means to be an _incubator_. We don’t recruit startups from around the world. We don’t have batches. And we never ask for equity. There’s nothing wrong with doing it that way. Other programs are great at that. But we’re cowboys. We think differently and we change up the game. 🤠

Blockchain Hub Prague was created in 2017 for blockchain startups to synergize and succeed by sharing an office and access to development resources. Since then, we’ve become a centerpiece of the Prague startup community, especially for international founders. We kinda branched beyond “blockchain only” per se, but we are still all software 🤓 startups.

Of the 25 people working from our office located in Karlin, there are 13 countries represented. It’s a hyperactive environment and on Wednesdays there is language lunch where we take turns learning new languages like Chinese, Arabic, Georgian, and Thai.

When you visit for a meeting or just to say hi, the office is just [here on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/oCFvTAR4F982)

Our doors are open to visitors, preferably weekdays 10am-4pm.

There are loads of events happening. Join our Meetup page at [Meetup.com | Blockchain Hub Prague](http://meetup.com/blockchainhubprague/)

We are also on [Facebook | Blockchain Hub Prague](https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainHubPrague/)

_Kudos for reading all the way to the end!_

It’s an honor to serve so many talented people. If you’re in this community, I trust you have that feeling everyday that you are doing the **most important work of your lives**! If that’s not you and you’re still looking for the passion, give me a call, let’s chat.
