Lunch Language Exchange is a weekly programme for our members. It has started in January with Czech language and Andrea as teacher. Our general idea is that everyone who wants to take part will bring their lunch to work, and together we will learn/teach something new between 1pm and 2pm.

In February the main language is Chinese and our teacher is Shuyong from Crowdholding.
